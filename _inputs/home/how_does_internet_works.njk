        <h3>A simple network</h3>


        <p><img alt="Two computers linked together" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8441/internet-schema-1.png"
                style="height: 152px; width: 600px;"></p>

        <p>Such a network is not limited to two computers. You can connect as many computers as you wish. But it gets
            complicated quickly. If you're trying to connect, say, ten computers, you need 45 cables, with nine plugs
            per computer!</p>

        <p><img alt="Ten computers all together" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8443/internet-schema-2.png"
                style="height: 576px; width: 600px;"></p>

        <p>To solve this problem, each computer on a network is connected to a special tiny computer called a
            <em>router</em>. This <em>router</em> has only one job: like a signaler at a railway station, it makes sure
            that a message sent from a given computer arrives at the right destination computer. To send a message to
            computer B, computer A must send the message to the router, which in turn forwards the message to computer B
            and makes sure the message is not delivered to computer C.</p>

        <p>Once we add a router to the system, our network of 10 computers only requires 10 cables: a single plug for
            each computer and a router with 10 plugs.</p>

        <p><img alt="Ten computers with a router" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8445/internet-schema-3.png"

        <h3 id="A_network_of_networks">A network of networks</h3>

        <p>So far so good. But what about connecting hundreds, thousands, billions of computers? Of course a single <em>router</em>
            can't scale that far, but, if you read carefully, we said that a <em>router</em> is a computer like any
            other, so what keeps us from connecting two <em>routers</em> together? Nothing, so let's do that.</p>

        <p><img alt="Two routers linked together" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8447/internet-schema-4.png">
        </p>

        <p>By connecting computers to routers, then routers to routers, we are able to scale infinitely.</p>

        <p><img alt="Routers linked to routers" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8449/internet-schema-5.png"
                style="height: 563px; width: 600px;"></p>

        <p>Such a network comes very close to what we call the Internet, but we're missing something. We built that
            network for our own purposes. There are other networks out there: your friends, your neighbors, anyone can
            have their own network of computers. But it's not really possible to set cables up between your house and
            the rest of the world, so how can you handle this? Well, there are already cables linked to your house, for
            example, electric power and telephone. The telephone infrastructure already connects your house with anyone
            in the world so it is the perfect wire we need. To connect our network to the telephone infrastructure, we
            need a special piece of equipment called a <em>modem</em>. This <em>modem</em> turns the information from
            our network into information manageable by the telephone infrastructure and vice versa.</p>

        <p><img alt="A router linked to a modem" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8451/internet-schema-6.png"
                style="height: 340px; width: 600px;"></p>

        <p>So we are connected to the telephone infrastructure. The next step is to send the messages from our network
            to the network we want to reach. To do that, we will connect our network to an Internet Service Provider
            (ISP). An ISP is a company that manages some special <em>routers</em> that are all linked together and can
            also access other ISPs' routers. So the message from our network is carried through the network of ISP
            networks to the destination network. The Internet consists of this whole infrastructure of networks.</p>

        <h3 id="Finding_computers">Finding computers</h3>

        <p>If you want to send a message to a computer, you have to specify which one. Thus any computer linked to a
            network has a unique address that identifies it, called an "IP address" (where IP stands for <em>Internet
                Protocol</em>). It's an address made of a series of four numbers separated by dots, for example: <code>192.168.2.10</code>.
        </p>

        <p>That's perfectly fine for computers, but we human beings have a hard time remembering that sort of address.
            To make things easier, we can alias an IP address with a human readable name called a <em>domain name</em>.
            For example (at the time of writing; IP addresses can change) <code>google.com</code> is the domain name
            used on top of the IP address <code>173.194.121.32</code>. So using the domain name is the easiest way for
            us to reach a computer over the Internet.</p>

        <p><img alt="Show how a domain name can alias an IP address"
                src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8405/dns-ip.png" style="height: 160px; width: 330px;"></p>

        <h3 id="Internet_and_the_web">Internet and the web</h3>

        <p>As you might notice, when we browse the Web with a Web browser, we usually use the domain name to reach a
            website. Does that mean the Internet and the Web are the same thing? It's not that simple. As we saw, the
            Internet is a technical infrastructure which allows billions of computers to be connected all together.
            Among those computers, some computers (called <em>Web servers</em>) can send messages intelligible to web
            browsers. The <em>Internet</em> is an infrastructure, whereas the <em>Web</em> is a service built on top of
            the infrastructure. It is worth noting there are several other services built on top of the Internet, such
            as email and <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/IRC">IRC</a>.</p>
