            fields are the most basic form widgets. They are a very convenient way to let the user enter any kind of

        <p>All basic text controls share some common behaviors:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>They can be marked as <code><a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-readonly">readonly</a></code> (the user cannot
                modify the input value but it is still sent with the rest of the form data) or <code><a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-disabled">disabled</a></code> (the input value
                can't be modified and is never sent with the rest of the form data).
            </li>
            <li>They can have a <code><a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-placeholder">placeholder</a></code>; this is
                text that appears inside the text input box that should be used to briefly describe the purpose of the
                box.
            </li>
            <li>They can be constrained in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/size"><code>size</code></a> (the
                physical size of the box) and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/maxlength"

        <pre class="brush: html">&lt;input type="text" id="comment" name="comment" value="I'm a text field"&gt;</pre>

        <p>Single line text fields have only one true constraint: if you type text with line breaks, the browser removes
            those line breaks before sending the data to the server.</p>

        <div class="blockIndicator note">
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: HTML5 enhanced the basic original single line text field by adding special values
                for the <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-type">type</a></code> attribute that
                enforce specific validation constraints and other features, for example specific to entering URLs or
                numbers. We'll cover those in the next article, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/HTML5_input_types">The
                    HTML5 input types</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <h4 id="Password_field">Password field</h4>

        <p>One of the original input types was the <code>password</code> text field type:</p>

        <pre class="brush: html">&lt;input type="password" id="pwd" name="pwd"&gt;</pre>

        <p>The <code>password</code> value doesn't add any special constraints to the entered text, but it does obscure
            the value entered into the field (e.g. with dots or asterisks) so it can't be easily read by others.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind this is just a user interface feature; unless you submit your form securely, it will get sent in
            plain text, which is bad for security — a malicious party could intercept your data and steal passwords,
            credit card details, or whatever else you've submitted. The best way to protect users from this is to host
            any pages involving forms over a secure connection (i.e. at an <code>https://</code> ... address), so the
            data is encrypted before it is sent.</p>

        <p>Browsers recognize the security implications of sending form data over an insecure connection, and have
            warnings to deter users from using insecure forms. For more information on what Firefox implements, see <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Insecure_passwords">Insecure passwords</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="Hidden_content">Hidden content</h3>

        <p>Another original text control is the <code>hidden</code> input type. This is used to create a form control
            that is invisible to the user, but is still sent to the server along with the rest of the form data once
            submitted — for example you might want to submit a timestamp to the server stating when an order was placed.
            Because it is hidden, the user can not see nor intentionally edit the value, it will never receive focus,
            and a screen reader will not notice it either.</p>

        <pre class="brush: html">&lt;input type="hidden" id="timestamp" name="timestamp" value="1286705410"&gt;
</pre>

        <p>If you create such an element, it's required to set its <code>name</code> and <code>value</code> attributes.
            The value can be dynamically set via JavaScript. The <code>hidden</code> input type should not have an
            associated label.</p>

        <p>Other text input types, like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/search"
                                           title="&lt;input> elements of type search are text fields designed for the user to enter search queries into. These are functionally identical to text inputs, but may be styled differently by the user agent. ">search</a>,
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/url"
               title="&lt;input> elements of type url are used to let the user enter and edit a URL.">url</a>, and <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/tel"

Unlike &lt;input type="email"> and &lt;input type="url"> , the input value is not automatically validated to a particular format before the form can be submitted, because formats for telephone numbers vary so much around the world.'>tel</a>,
            were added with HTML5. Those will be covered in the next tutorial, HTML5 input types.</p>

        <h2 id="Checkable_items_checkboxes_and_radio_buttons">Checkable items: checkboxes and radio buttons</h2>

        <p>Checkable items are controls whose state you can change by clicking on them or their associated labels. There
            are two kinds of checkable item: the check box and the radio button. Both use the <a class="new"
                                                                                                 href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes//checked"
                                                                                                 rel="nofollow"><code>checked</code></a>
            attribute to indicate whether the widget is checked by default or not.</p>

        <p>It's worth noting that these widgets do not behave exactly like other form widgets. For most form widgets,
            once the form is submitted all widgets that have a <a class="new"
                                                                  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/name"
                                                                  rel="nofollow"><code>name</code></a> attribute are
            sent, even if no value has been filled out. In the case of checkable items, their values are sent only if
            they are checked. If they are not checked, nothing is sent, not even their name. If they are checked but
            have no value, the name is sent with a value of <em>on.</em></p>

        <p>A radio button is created using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input"
                                                  title="The HTML &lt;input> element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and user agent. "><code>&lt;input&gt;</code></a>
            element with its <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-type">type</a></code> attribute set
            to the value <code>radio</code>:</p>

        <pre class="brush: html">&lt;input type="radio" id="soup" name="meal" checked&gt;</pre>

        <p>Several radio buttons can be tied together. If they share the same value for their <code><a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-name">name</a></code> attribute, they will be
            considered to be in the same group of buttons. Only one button in a given group may be checked at a time;
            this means that when one of them is checked all the others automatically get unchecked. When the form is
            sent, only the value of the checked radio button is sent. If none of them are checked, the whole pool of
            radio buttons is considered to be in an unknown state and no value is sent with the form. Once one of the
            radio buttons in a same-named group of buttons is checked, it is not possible for the user to uncheck all of
            the buttons without resetting the form.</p>

        <h2 id="Actual_buttons">Actual buttons</h2>

        <p>The radio button isn't actually a button, despite its name; let's move on and look at actual buttons! There
            are three input types that produce buttons:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt><code>submit</code></dt>
            <dd>Sends the form data to the server. For <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button"
                                                          title="The HTML &lt;button> element represents a clickable button, used to submit forms or anywhere in a document for accessible, standard button functionality."><code>&lt;button&gt;</code></a>
                elements, omitting the <code>type</code> attribute (or an invalid value of <code>type</code>) results in
                a submit button.
            </dd>
            <dt><code>reset</code></dt>
            <dd>Resets all form widgets to their default values.</dd>
            <dt><code>button</code></dt>
            <dd>Buttons that have no automatic effect but can be customized using JavaScript code.</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>In addition, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button"
                               title="The HTML &lt;button> element represents a clickable button, used to submit forms or anywhere in a document for accessible, standard button functionality."><code>&lt;button&gt;</code></a>
            element can take a <code>type</code> attribute to mimic these three input types. The main difference between
            the two is that actual <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> elements are much more stylable.</p>

        <div class="blockIndicator note">
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: The <code>image</code> input type also renders as a button. We'll cover that later
                too.</p>
        </div>

&lt;input type="button" value="This is an anonymous button"&gt;</pre>

        <p>Buttons always behave the same whether you use a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button"
                                                               title="The HTML &lt;button> element represents a clickable button, used to submit forms or anywhere in a document for accessible, standard button functionality."><code>&lt;button&gt;</code></a>
            element or an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input"
                             title="The HTML &lt;input> element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and user agent.

            element. As you can see from the examples, however, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button"
                                                                   title="The HTML &lt;button> element represents a clickable button, used to submit forms or anywhere in a document for accessible, standard button functionality."><code>&lt;button&gt;</code></a>
            elements let you use HTML in their content, which is inserted between the opening and closing <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>
            tags. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input"
                     title="The HTML &lt;input> element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and user agent. "><code>&lt;input&gt;</code></a>
            elements on the other hand are empty elements; their displayed content is inserted inside the
            <code>value</code> attribute, and therefore only accepts plain text as content.</p>

        <p>The following examples show default, focused, and disabled button input types — in Firefox 71 and Safari 13
            on macOS and Chrome 79 and Edge 18 on Windows 10.</p>

        <h3 id="Image_button">Image button</h3>

        <p>The <strong>image button</strong> control is rendered exactly like an <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img"
                    title="The HTML &lt;img> element embeds an image into the document."><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></a>
            element, except that when the user clicks on it, it behaves like a submit button.</p>

        <p>An image button is created using an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input"
                                                  title="The HTML &lt;input> element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and user agent. "><code>&lt;input&gt;</code></a>
            element with its <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-type">type</a></code> attribute set
            to the value <code>image</code>. This element supports exactly the same set of attributes as the <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img"
                    title="The HTML &lt;img> element embeds an image into the document."><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></a>
            element, plus all the attributes supported by other form buttons.</p>

        <pre class="brush: html">&lt;input type="image" alt="Click me!" src="my-img.png" width="80" height="30"&gt;</pre>

        <p>If the image button is used to submit the form, this control doesn't submit its value — instead, the X and Y
            coordinates of the click on the image are submitted (the coordinates are relative to the image, meaning that
            the upper-left corner of the image represents the coordinate (0, 0)). The coordinates are sent as two
            key/value pairs:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The X value key is the value of the <code><a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-name">name</a></code> attribute followed by
                the string "<em>.x</em>".
            </li>
            <li>The Y value key is the value of the <code><a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-name">name</a></code> attribute followed by
                the string "<em>.y</em>".
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>So for example when you click on the image at coordinate (123, 456) and it submits via the <code>get</code>
            method, you'll see the values appended to the URL as follows:</p>

        <pre>http://foo.com?pos.x=123&amp;pos.y=456</pre>

        <p>This is a very convenient way to build a "hot map". How these values are sent and retrieved is detailed in
            the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data">Sending form data</a> article.</p>

        <h2 id="File_picker">File picker</h2>

        <p>There is one last <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> type that came to us in early HTML: the file input type. Forms
            are able to send files to a server (this specific action is also detailed in the <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data">Sending form data</a> article). The
            file picker widget can be used to choose one or more files to send.</p>

        <p>To create a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file">file picker widget</a>, you use the <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input"
                    title="The HTML &lt;input> element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and user agent. "><code>&lt;input&gt;</code></a>
            element with its <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-type">type</a></code> attribute set
            to <code>file</code>. The types of files that are accepted can be constrained using the <code><a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-accept">accept</a></code> attribute. In addition,
            if you want to let the user pick more than one file, you can do so by adding the <code><a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-multiple">multiple</a></code> attribute.</p>

        <h4 id="Example">Example</h4>

        <p>In this example, a file picker is created that requests graphic image files. The user is allowed to select
            multiple files in this case.</p>

        <pre class="brush: html">&lt;input type="file" name="file" id="file" accept="image/*" multiple&gt;</pre>

        <p>On some mobile devices, the file picker can access photos, videos, and audio captured directly by the
            device's camera and microphone by adding capture information to the <code>accept</code> attribute like so:
        </p>

        <pre>&lt;input type="file" accept="image/*;capture=camera"&gt;
&lt;input type="file" accept="video/*;capture=camcorder"&gt;
&lt;input type="file" accept="audio/*;capture=microphone"&gt;</pre>
